serverEssentials

serverEssentials is a bukkit plugin that will provide the tools and customizable features for your minecraft server.
Anyone can contribute and add in to the plugin, but you must follow the guide lines, I will state below

Guide lines and rules

-If you need to contact Rapid do it via twitter @RapidWolf_
-You can add what ever you like to the plugin, BUT anything stupid, or can ruin servers will be removed and not added to the plugin
-When making your own feature at in at the top somewhere I comment stating who it was made by
For example

/*
*Made by UserNameHere
* On DateHere
/*

-You can not take the plugin and pass it off as your own, that is copy right and it is illegal.

Any questions direct them to the original developer of the plugin via twitter @RapidWolf_
